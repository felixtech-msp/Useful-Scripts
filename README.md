# Useful Scripts
 
This repository is a collection of scripts that make admin life easier.
I developed or found them over time. Feel free to use them and change them for your needs.

## unifi_import_unms_lecert.sh

If you operate a Ubiquiti UniFi Controller and a UISP Server on the same machine under the same domain your UISP server will automatically get Let's Encrypt certificates for you.
This script imports those certificates to your UniFi Controller automatically.

## update-docker-images.sh

This script pulls the :latest image of all Docker images which are on the system.
